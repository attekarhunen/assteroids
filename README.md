Me trying to learn a bit of game programming with [Pygame](www.pygame.org)

## Getting started

You need Python and Pygame. I am using Python 3, it is preinstalled in Ubuntu

### Prequisites
```
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install pygame
```

And then to run:

```
python3 game.py
```

On my Windows computer, I just installed Python 3.6, and then:

```
pip install pygame
python game.py
```
